# CNN-Evolution
This repository contains code for our Natural Computing final project, called Structure-Based Evolution of Convolutional Neural Network Architectures.

We created a system that uses a genetic algorithm to generate convolutional neural networks. These networks are tested on the CIFAR-10 benchmark dataset. Our best network achieved a validation accuracy of 80%.

Modify and run `main.py` to generate and train networks using the given settings.

# Dependencies
* Keras
* TensorFlow
* Matplotlib
* Numpy
* Pandas

# Files

* `initialization.py`: module for creating random network representations (as dictionaries) that are accepted by the genetic algorithm.
* `main.py`: main file of this project.
* `run_benchmark_model.py`: module for creating a benchmark CNN based on VGGNET and training it on CIFAR-10.
* `run_dict_model.py`: module for creating a CNN model in Keras based on a network representation as generated by the genetic algorithm.
* `utils.py`: module containing utility functions for saving and loading objects using cPickle.
* `validate.py`: module for validating a given network representation.
